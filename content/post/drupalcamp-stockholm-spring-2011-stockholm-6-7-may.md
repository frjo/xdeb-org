Anthother [DrupalCamp in Stockholm](http://spring2011.drupalcamp.se/). Come and meet the Swedish Drupal community and listen to how CNN and Al Jazeera use Drupal.

[xdeb.net](https://xdeb.net/) is happy to sponsor the event and I will give a talk "[Drush 4, more awesome than ever](http://spring2011.drupalcamp.se/schedule/drush-4-more-awesome-ever)".

Not using Drush yet? Only using it for installing and updating modules? Come then and see what you can do with Drush 4.

I will quickly run through the simple parts and then concentrate on things like site aliases, scripting and building Drush commands.
