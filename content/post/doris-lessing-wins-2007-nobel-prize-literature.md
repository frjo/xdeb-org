This must be the first time the Nobel Prize for Literature goes to a author that I have read (and very much enjoyed).

> that epicist of the female experience, who with scepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny

I don't really get the motivation given by the [Svenska Akademien](http://www.svenskaakademien.se/) but I do think she is well worth the prize.

The latest book I have read by [Doris Lessing](http://www.dorislessing.org/) is "Mara and Dann". The ones that I remember most strongly is the series "Canopus in Argos: Archives" with books like [Shikasta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikasta) and [The Sentimental Agents in the Volyen Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sentimental_Agents_in_the_Volyen_Empire).

Make time to read books! Get e.g. one of Doris Lessing books and give yourself some perspective on life, the universe, and everything.
