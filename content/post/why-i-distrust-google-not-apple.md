Today Daringfireball.net linked to an [article by Mike Elgan](http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/columns/executive_tech/article.php/3801006/Googles-Business-Model-YOU-Are-the-Product.htm) about Google with this quote.

> Google makes billions of dollars in revenue each fiscal quarter. That money comes about by the same process that all companies use: They sell a product to their customers. Their customers pay money for that product.

> Who’s Google’s customer? You? Really? When’s the last time you paid Google for anything?

> Advertisers are Google’s customer. What do they sell to advertisers? They sell you. Or, at least, they rent you out, or provide access to you.

This is why I on a basic level distrust Google and don't use there services for anything vital in my business or private life. It's not that I believe they are "evil" or anything like that, I simply don't trust them enough.

Apple is different. I know that I'm their customer and the product they want to sell is hardware, i.e. Macs, iPhones and iPads. They want to keep me happy because I give them money. I can trust that.

I like Apples products a lot! I like some of Googles services as well, search, Gmail and Analytic are all very good services. But liking something it not the same as trusting it.

I don't use Facebook for the same reason. I do use Twitter, and enjoy using it, but I'm hesitant. I much rather be using some distributed Twitter-like protocol.

Trust is important.
