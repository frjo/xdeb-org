With Debian 10 (buster) the default firewall is nftables so it's time to convert my iptables rules.

Since Debian stable is never first with anything I was surprised to see how relative few articles and blogs there are about nftables compered to iptables. The official documentation is dense and hard to interpret when you not are a network protocol expert.

At the bottom you find links to the resources I found most useful. With this post I will explain the things I learnt and show the configuration now running on my Debian 10 servers.

After understanding how nftables works I like it better than iptables. Cleaner rules, support for ipv6 natively and the performance is reported to be improved as well. The last bit I will likely not notice much since my servers all have relative low traffic.

(See my iptables set up in [My first 2 minutes on a server - letting Ansible do the work](/post/2016/06/23/my-first-2-minutes-on-a-server-letting-ansible-do-the-work/))

*Update 2020-07-27*: A kind reader noticed that IPv6 ping was not working correctly. Needed to explicitly allow it in the outgoing rules. Setting "policy accept" on the outgoing chain also fixed the issue.

*Update 2020-12-20*: A reader wrote in and kindly offered a tips on how to allow VPN clients to communicate with each other. Might be useful when the VPN server is only used by friends and family. For a public VPN it's not recommended. See the last rule in the incoming chain below.

*Update 2020-12-21*: Updated rules to include use of hook ingress to filter bad packages early. See link at bottom to Samuel Forestier blog post where I learned this.


## Important things I learnt

1. You can name tables, chains etc whatever you like and you can have multiple sets of them. Specific settings on them control what they do and in what order they are run.
2. Whenever you have a need to specify a group of IP addresses, ports, interfaces and what not, use sets. They make rules non repetitive, easy to read and write and allow the system to optimise performance.
3. Rules with "limit" need to be put before rules accepting "established" connections.
4. If you do not have "policy accept" on your outgoing chain you need to explicitly allow IPv6 ICMP.
5. The hook order is good to know, ingress -> prerouting -> input/output/forward -> postrouting

## My nftable config script

This is the rules I run on my servers, the ports will vary depending on services. The WireGuard VPN part I only run on my VPN server.

I have added comments in the script below explaining most parts.

On Debian the nftables configuration file is: `/etc/nftables.conf`

~~~~ shell
#!/usr/sbin/nft -f

# Hook order is: ingress -> prerouting -> input/output/forward -> postrouting

# Start by flushing all the rules.
flush ruleset

# Defining variables is easy in nftables scripts.
define wan = enp3s0
define vpn = wg0
define vpn_net = 10.10.10.0/24

# Setting up a table, simple firewalls will only need one table but there can be multiple.
# The "inet" say that this table will handle both ipv4 (ip) and ipv6 (ip6).
# The name is "firewall" you can name it anything you like.
table inet firewall {
  # Sets are dictionaries and maps of ports, addresses etc.
  # These can then easily be used in the rules.
  # Sets can be named whatever you like.
  # TCP ports to allow, here we add ssh, http and https.
  set tcp_accepted {
    # The "inet_service" are for tcp/udp ports and "flags interval" allows to set intervals, see the mosh ports below.
    type inet_service; flags interval;
    elements = {
      22,80,443
    }
  }

  # UDP ports to allow, here we add ports for WireGuard and mosh.

  }

  # The first chain, can be named anything you like.
  chain incoming {
    # This line set what traffic the chain will handle, the priority and default policy.
    # The priority comes in when you in another table have a chain set to "hook input" and want to specify in what order they should run.
    # Use a semicolon to separate multiple commands on one row.
    type filter hook input priority 0; policy drop;

I generate the above from [an Ansible template](https://github.com/frjo/ansible-roles/blob/master/common/templates/etc/nftables.conf.j2) in my "common" role that I deploy to all my servers. See [frjo/ansible-roles](https://github.com/frjo/ansible-roles) for more information.


## Monitor nftables

To see all active rules:

~~~~
$ nft list ruleset
~~~~

To see a specific table:

~~~~
$ nft list table inet firewall
~~~~

Flush all the rules. This will leave the server completely open.

~~~~
$ nft flush ruleset
~~~~
