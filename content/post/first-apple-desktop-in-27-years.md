My main computer is now a iMac 5K with 1 TB SSD. This after using Apple laptops for 27 years.

I bought my first laptop in 1992, a Macintosh PowerBook 160. As a university student I got a big discount, but it still cost a lot. I have used a string of other Apple laptops since then. None is remembered as warmly. I still have the PowerBook tucked away in a box.

Owning a Apple laptop back then felt luxurious and very modern. For a lot of people my PowerBook was the first laptop they had seen in action. With Mac OS 7, the design with built in trackball and comparatively light weight it was years ahead of the competition.

I used the PowerBook for, at least, four years and it still boots up to this day. And the keyboard still works.

After a couple of years I got a Apple 12” Colour display, big screen and in colour! Pure luxury. Always used my laptops with external displays through the years.

My latest laptop is a MacBook Pro 13” Core i7 non retina from 2012. Most of the time it has been connected to a Apple 27” Thunderbolt Display. With power and a number of ports the Thunderbolt display doubles as a dock. It is a really nice setup.

I have upgraded the MacBook with a 1 TB SSD and max RAM. This makes it perform well and I can still do all my daily work on it without issues. And the keyboard still works.

While the MacBook from 2012 still works well I started longing for a retina display. A bit more performance and RAM would not hurt either.

Looking att Apple.com there is one laptop that has a working keyboard and that is the brand new 16" model. The only 5K display in the store is an LG model. Since you can not upgrade the RAM in an MacBook you need to pay Apples premium prices.

MacBook Pro|Price
:----|----:
MacBook Pro 16" i7/32 GB RAM/1 TB SSD|36 599 SEK
LG UltraFine 5K-skärm|13 390 SEK
Total|49 989 SEK

This is a nice setup but it also expensive. It also has more performance that I really need and I would prefer an 13" model that is easier to carry around the few times I need to. So more money than I want to spend on a system that not really fits me.

The alternatives is to wait or to get a desktop computer, an 27" iMac 5K. I picked the later.

iMac 5K (entry CPU)|Price
:----|----:
iMac 5K i5/1 TB SSD|28 371 SEK
Extra 32 GB RAM|2 000 SEK
Total|30 371 SEK

That is a lot less expensive. On the iMac 5K you can still upgrade the RAM yourself. The stock model comes with 8 GB so adding två 16 GB sticks make a total of 40 GB RAM.

Even with the top CPU option it's substantially less.

iMac (top CPU)|Price
:----|----:
iMac 5K i9/1 TB SSD|36 771 SEK
Extra 32 GB RAM|2 000 SEK
Total|38 771 SEK

For the few times I need to be portable I will use my old MacBook Pro or an iPad.

The iMac 5K is a really good computer with an excellent display. I have connected my Apple 27” Thunderbolt Display to the iMac so I have a lot of screen real estate.

The Thunderbolt Display is of course non retina but it's still a good screen. I do all my main work on the iMac display.
