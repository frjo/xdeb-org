My main computer is now a iMac 5K with 1 TB SSD. This after using Apple laptops for 27 years.

I bought my first laptop in 1992, a Macintosh PowerBook 160. As a university student I got a big discount, but it still cost a lot. I have used a string of other Apple laptops since then. None is remembered as warmly. I still have the PowerBook tucked away in a box.

Owning a Apple laptop back then felt luxurious and very modern. For a lot of people my PowerBook was the first laptop they had seen in action. With Mac OS 7, the design with built in trackball and comparatively light weight it was years ahead of the competition.

I used the PowerBook for, at least, four years and it still boots up to this day. And the keyboard still works.

After a couple of years I got a Apple 12” Colour display, big screen and in colour! Pure luxury. Always used my laptops with external displays through the years.

My latest laptop is a MacBook Pro 13” Core i7 non retina from 2012. Most of the time it has been connected to a Apple 27” Thunderbolt Display. With power and a number of ports the Thunderbolt display doubles as a dock. It is a really nice setup!

Do not understand why Apple does not remove the computer from the iMac 5K and sell it as an external display.

I have upgraded the MacBook with a 1 TB SSD and max RAM. This makes it perform well and I can still do all my daily work on it without issues. And the keyboard still works.

While the MacBook from 2012 still works well I started longing for a retina display. A bit more performance and RAM would not hurt either.

The iMac 5K is a really good computer with an excellent display.
