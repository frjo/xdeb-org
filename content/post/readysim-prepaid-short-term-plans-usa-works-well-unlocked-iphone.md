[Ready SIM](http://www.readysim.com/) is a relative new mobile service in the USA that I first read about in this Ars Technica article [Ready SIM offers cheap, short-term, and disposable mobile service](http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/ready-sim-offers-cheap-short-term-and-disposable-mobile-service/).

When I needed a mobile solution for a trip to the USA recently I luckily remembered that article. I looked in to some other options but ReadySIM seemed to be the best and easiest.

* You can get the SIM-card delivered to you home address if you can order it a couple of weeks in advance.
* To activate it you only need to send a single SMS with the area code you want a phone number for.
* Another SMS will get you the APN settings.

Other solutions seemed to require time consuming registration processes and that the SIM was bought at a airport or a local store in the USA.

Upon arriving to the USA I switch SIM-cards in my phone and did the setup while waiting in the immigration queue. It just worked and both reception and data speeds was decent. Overall a pleasant experience.

One annoyance is that I received quite a lot of SMS spam. Not sure of the best way to stop that, never looked in to it since I was there for only a week.

The cost for me was 55 USD for a 30 day plan and 2 GB data (really only needed a week but wanted more data). That also included unlimited talk and SMS.

The price seems to be competitive in the USA but it is expensive when compared to services like [OCN mobile ONE](http://service.ocn.ne.jp/english/mobile/one/) in Japan. There I pay around 11 USD per month for 3 GB data with excellent reception and data speeds.

Here in Sweden Telia, [Telia Refill](https://www.telia.se/privat/telefoni/abonnemang-kontantkort/produkt/telia-refill-startpaket), seems to charge around 18 USD per month for 3 GB data with good reception and data speeds.
