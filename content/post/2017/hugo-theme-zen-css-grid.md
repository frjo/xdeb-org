I have released the css grid version of my [Zen theme for Hugo](https://github.com/frjo/hugo-theme-zen). This site have been using it for a couple of month. Read more at [Layout with CSS grid and flex, it's really nice](/post/2017/08/29/layout-with-css-grid-and-flex-its-really-nice/).

With the resent release of [Microsoft Edge 16](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/10/17/edgehtml-16-fall-creators-update/) there is support for css grid in all the major browsers.

From my limited testing the CSS grid support in Edge 16 seems to work just fine. Just as it does in Safari, Firefox and Chrome. Working with CSS will be less frustrating moving forward.
