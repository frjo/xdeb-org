</a>As a result of the [Treaty of Lisbon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon) EU may soon have a president. [Some](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jul/15/tony-blair-eu-presidency) [believe](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/can-anyone-stop-blair-becoming-the-first-president-of-europe-1750106.html) that [Tony Blair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair) has a good chance of getting the job.

In my opinion that would be a bad choice, really bad. I believe this because it was Tony Blair and George Bush that was responsible for the Iraq war. Apparently Blair [prayed to God](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4772142.stm) and God told him it was OK to invade Iraq.

[Iraq Body Count](http://www.iraqbodycount.org/) uses a survey of online news reports to produce its running tally, 100 000 civilian dead since the start of the war. A [Lancet surveys of Iraq War casualties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancet_surveys_of_Iraq_War_casualties) from 2006 indicates that the number can be far, far higher.

I would much rather see Tony Blair in front of the  [International Criminal Court](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court) charged with [Crime against humanity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_against_humanity) then becoming EU President.
