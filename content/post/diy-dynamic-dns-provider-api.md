Got a notice from my ISP that in a few weeks time I will no longer have a static IP address. Not the ISP fault however, they would be happy to provide the service. It is the company that manages the city fiber network that blames a system upgrade for the coming inability to provide static IP addresses.

The municipality should never have sold off the optic fiber network to a private company. Important things like roads, hospitals, schools, the police and city fiber networks should be public and nothing else.

Unwilling to give up my home server I started looking for a solution.


## Dynamic DNS


### Why not use one of many dynamic DNS providers?

I do not mind paying for stuff but I want to use as few services as possible.

My first instinct is to self host. When that is not a good option I use a few trusted services, e.g. [GleSYS](https://glesys.com/).

Doing it yourself is also a lot more fun.


### Find a good server hosting company with an API

Luckily my favourite hosting company here in Sweden, [GleSYS](https://glesys.com/), has an [excellent API](https://github.com/GleSYS/API/wiki/Api-Introduction).

They allow a minimum TTL of 60s, perfekt for a dynamic DNS setup. After some questions on their [community Slack](https://glesys.se/community) I was ready to start experimenting.

Other hosting companies that has API for this includes [Linode](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/domains) and [DigitalOcean](https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/) as well as all the big cloud providers I assume.


### For a server with private IP address behind a router


#### Use a cron script that runs on reboot and every 5 minuts

This is a bit crud but gets the job done.

File: `/etc/cron.d/dynamicdns`

~~~~ shell
@reboot root if [ -x /usr/local/bin/dynamicdns.sh ]; then /usr/local/bin/dynamicdns.sh; fi
*/5 * * * * root if [ -x /usr/local/bin/dynamicdns.sh ]; then /usr/local/bin/dynamicdns.sh; fi
~~~~

File: `/usr/local/bin/dynamicdns.sh`

~~~~ shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# shell script hardening
set -euo pipefail

IP=$(curl --silent https://ipinfo.io/ip)
/usr/local/bin/dynamicdns.py "${IP}"
~~~~

I leave it up to the reader to combine `dynamicdns.sh` and `dynamicdns.py` in to a single script if running via cron.


### For a server with a public IP address

This is my own use case.


#### Use DHCP client script hooks to detect when there is a new IP address

First job was to find out how to detect when the IP address changes and run a script to update the DNS. Turns out there is [DHCP client script enter and exit hooks](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/isc-dhcp-client/dhclient-script.8.en.html) that can take care of this.

On Debian you place your exit script in `/etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/`.

File: `/etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/dynamicdns`

Replace "enp3s0" with your WAN interface.

~~~~ shell
if [ "${interface}" = "enp3s0" ]; then
    case ${reason}" in BOUND|REBIND|RENEW)
        /usr/local/bin/dynamicdns.py "${new_ip_address}"
        ;;
    esac
fi
~~~~

This will run the `dynamicdns.py` script when changes are detected on the main WAN interface and there is a new IP address. See documentation for what reasons BOUND|REBIND|RENEW stands for. The interface, reason and new_ip_address variables are provided by the DHCP client.


### Now on to the script that actually update the DNS entries.

I opted to write it in Python. It needs to take the `new_ip_address` as an argument, remember the last IP address, do some sanity checking and talk to the API. Logging is always a good idea as well.

File: `/usr/local/bin/dynamicdns.py`

OBS! You will need to set the variables and adapt `updatedns()` for your providers API. The way you specify `dns_records` might need adapting as well.

## Conclusion

With this in place the DNS entries for my home server should update within 60s of an IP address change. This is ok for the services I run. Not as good as a real static IP address but it will do for now.

The most useful function for my home server is as a VPN with Wireguard. Later this year, when we hopefully can start traveling again, it will see some traffic after many month of rest.
