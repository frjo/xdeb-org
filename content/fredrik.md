*A mind is like a parachute. It doesn't work if it's not open.*

Welcome to my corner of the net. I work as a web developer and Linux sysadmin, more about that on [xdeb.net](https://xdeb.net/).

I have a degree in political science but my interest in technology turned my career towards IT. I maintain a keen interest in politics. A family man that read a lot of books, watch SVT, BBC and sci-fi TV series and keep up with the scientific discoveries of our time. Like things that makes the world a better place. All humans have equal value.
